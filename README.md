# E-Desh Tracking System Detailed Timeline
E-Desh Courier Tracking System with delivery man details and information that doesn't show in the original website but exists in their API endpoint

# Purpose
This is a hobby project extending E-Desh courier platform timeline system to track delivery updates including the delivery person name and their phone number that doesn't show in the original website

# How does it work?
It uses the official website's API endpoint to display the content but as the original website doesn't show all the information on their front end, this project will overcome that. It uses flask API to make HTTP request and display the content on the front end.

# Libraries required
<pre>pip install requests flask flask-cors</pre>
